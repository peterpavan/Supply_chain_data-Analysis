# Supply_chain_data-Analysis

You have a bunch of data that tells you things like how much money you're making, what products are selling best, and how long it takes to get products ready. But sorting through all this data is tricky, especially when you're not sure what to focus on.

That's where supply chain analytics comes in. It helps you make sense of all the data and find ways to improve your business. For example, you might learn that certain products sell better in certain locations, or that you need to make more of a product because it's really popular.

In this project, we're going to dive into your data using SQL â€“ a tool for working with databases. We'll dig deep into the numbers to find out what's working well and what could use some improvement. Our goal is to give you practical ideas to make your business run smoother and make more money.
